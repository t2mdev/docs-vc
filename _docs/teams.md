The **T2M Teams App** is the place to enable users, change voice policies, and set phone numbers for your users using T2M's Direct Routing service (https://my.t2mhosted.com/apps/teams/). User Policies and other configurations for Teams must be managed within the Microsoft Teams Admin Center (https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/). Call details/related reporting, MACD activities, and any policy related configurations for Teams with T2M Direct Routing users are not available in the T2M Portal at this time. These will be coming soon with a future release of the portal
